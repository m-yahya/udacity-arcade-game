# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This project is an implementation of Frogger game where a player has to reach the water side (on the top) without colliding with any of the enemies (bugs). Once the player is reached the water side safely, its position will be set to default with the level incremented. The game will be won after completing five levels.
